          We have created a platform that focus on bettering the community through support via the application of donating time alternatively to monetary investments.  </p>
          <p>The individual time donator has the chance to donate their time to an area of importance that they feel is impactful to them and the community. </p>
          <p>The individual can also nominate the duration of the “time” they would like to donate to the cause they interested in. Ie. 2 hours, 5 hours, 10 hours etc. </p>
          <p>Using Working Bee users can explore a list of causes that need their time in a specific area over an array of opportunities. Eg, community gardens, parks, fund raisers.  </p>
          <p>While the core of Working Bee is to get the job done through “time” donation”, it also links individuals that have similar interests together creating strong relationships that can impact change in the community.
          Working Bee is a three step process:  </p>
          <ol role="list">
          <li>Choose the project to be involved in</li>
          <li>Choose your time to donate</li>
          <li>Show up and get the job done!</li>
          </ol>
